                        it’s done in 30 minutes? Or because we just can’t resist a buttery wine sauce? All of the above!

                        Turmeric is popular in smoothies and juices, but we upped the ante and used it to season
                        boneless
                        chicken thighs. Mixed with pumpkin pie spice, it makes a flavorful seasoning for boneless,

                        chicken thighs. Served on top of crispy naan and drizzled on a tangy yogurt sauce, you've got a

                        meal in just 20 minutes!
